# What is this based on?
.pull-left[

# Rethinking the purpose 
.pull-left[
- The superficial purpose of the conference is given by the programme 
- But the real purpose is everything in between the programme 
  + Getting to know people
  + Brainstorming of research ideas
  + New data sources 
  + New methods

#### Implications (1/2)
- Slides are advertisement of you and your research 
  + Do not explain everything
  + Leave things open 
  + Have contact information and a twitter handle on slides
- Never miss a break - do miss a sessions
  + People are there to network like you 
  + Say hi
  + Junior vs senior - what are you comfortable with?
- About SoMe: 'Troels' knows very little about academic SoMe... Get a twitter (or Blue Sky) account. Forget LinkedIn

.pull-left[
#### Implications (2/2)

- **The most important thing on the programme:** Conference dinner
  + And whatever happens afterwards
  + Always join whatever happens afterwards 
  
- Network theory:
  + Who are the the central nodes?
  + **Answer**: The most social people (e.g. smokers)
- Check the programme and who you want to speak with 
- Write them an email before and after the conference 
  + No reason to do so? Invent one
  
- Alcohol: A problem
